## About Me

Hey, there! My name is Nikita and I'm 26-years-old. I graduated from A.S. Griboedov Institute of International Law and Economics, majoring in linguist-translator. 

I used to work as a freelance translator of movies and series subtitles for 3 months. After that I worked as an Assistant of Audiovisual translation department for more than a year. I didn't actually translate anything at work. Mostly, I transcribed Russian and English videos and audios, created subtitles to videos in programms such as Adobe Affter Effects or Da Vinci Resolve and checked tasks, which were done by others, for errors. Sometimes I did some primitive video editing. I also took part in some kind of Machine Translation research of the company.

I've tried to take RS Schools Course 'JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 1' back in a days, but haven't succeded. This time, I hope, I'll finish the course and learn lots of new coding stuff.
